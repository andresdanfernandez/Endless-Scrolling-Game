## Endless Scrolling Game
This was my very first project after completing Harvard's CS50 Intro to Computer Science course!

## Motivation
I made this game originally to learn more about Python and its object-oriented principles. After completing the project, it solidified my passion for Computer Science and I haven't looked back!
